Built a clean and interactive to-do list web application that allows users to manage daily tasks efficiently. Key features include:

Add, edit, mark as complete, or delete tasks.

Search functionality to filter tasks in real-time.

"Clear All" button to remove all tasks instantly.

User-friendly interface with responsive design.

Fully built with vanilla JavaScript, without any frameworks.

This project demonstrates my understanding of DOM manipulation, event handling, and UI/UX principles using core web technologies.
